# Crowdfunding_ETL


A collaborative project to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL for extracting, transforming, and loading crowdfunding data from Excel files into a relational database.

## Background

For this project, We practiced built an ETL pipeline to process crowdfunding data from Excel files. We extracted and transformed the data first. Then we  created four CSV files to be uploaded into  our SQL database.

## Features

- Extract and transform crowdfunding and contact data from Excel files
- Create and export Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contact DataFrames as CSV files
- Design an ERD and table schema for the database
- Create and populate PostgreSQL database tables

## Usage

1. Run the .ipynb files to extract and transform data, and create CSV files.
2. Use the provided `crowdfunding_db_schema.sql` file to create tables in the PostgreSQL database.
3. Load the CSV files into the corresponding PostgreSQL tables.
4. Query the database to verify the data has been loaded correctly.

## Built With

- Python
- Pandas
- PostgreSQL
- Visual Studio Code
- Excel
